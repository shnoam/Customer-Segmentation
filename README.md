# Customer-Segmentation

## Overview

This mini-project involves customer segmentation using various clustering techniques.

The goal is to analyze customer data and group similar customers together based on their characteristics and behaviors.

It was developed as part of my preparation for an interview.


## In the code

- **Data Processing**: preprocess customer aggregated data.
- **Clustering**: Apply KMeans and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.
- **Visualization**: Visualize clusters and feature distributions using various plots.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Use PCA for visualization of high-dimensional data.

## Optional Future Work
  1.  Apply other tecniques to evaluate K-Means - for example, Siiluette score
  2.  Adjust DBSCAN parameters for better results
  3.  Explore more patterns in the data, apply seperate clustering on customer groups (e.g Gender, City, Membership type...)
